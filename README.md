Intraspect
=====================

A framework for the general creation, manipulation, and verification(TM) of Java class files.

Intraspect was built and is currently being maintained by [Ethan Ferguson](https://github.com/ethanf108/) and [Shaun Thornton](https://github.com/homeworkhopper/)

###Use Cases
The Intraspect framework can be used to generate Java class files from scratch, without a compiler. It can also be used to restructure or otherwise manipulate existing class files without the need to recompile their sources. This can be particularly useful when it is necessary to change the functionality of an already compiled tool or library but do not have access to its source code. With Intraspect, such a task would be possible.
